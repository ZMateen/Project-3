Bootcamp Kombat!

This is it! The last six months of our hard work all leads to this point. Two of our group mates (Marcin and Zaria) have traded barbs over the 
last six months and the unanimous group deccision was to create a fighting game to determine the outcome and winner of Zaria and Marcin 
verbal lashing. The end-project? Bootcamp Kombat!

Bootcamp Kombat!- a trivia-based game that calls the Open Trivia Database and retrieves the questions for the user and the computer to answer. 
The user has a predetermined amount of time to answer the questionand should the use answer correctly, the user scores a point. Should the user 
answer incorrectly, the computer scores a point instead. The user can also choose a setting as well as a fighter (based on the popular 
arcade game series Mortal Kombat).

This project was accomplished using ReactJs and CSS in the Front-End as well as MySQl, and Passport for user authentication in the Back-End.
